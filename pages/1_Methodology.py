    * Process Google Earth Engine (GEE) satellite images of Sagar Island to get water areas for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020.
    * Test few methods for automated shoreline detection
        * Method 1: GEE Otsuâ€™s thresholding algorithm
        * Method 2: CoastSat module 
    * GEE generate shapefile of shorelines for the four years
    * Using ArcGIS and DSAS: 
        * Digitize shoreline more accurately to get accurate transects at select shoreline locations
        * Generat Transects along the digitized shoreline.
        * Compute end poit rate (EPR) linear regression rates (LRR) of change (erosion or accretion).
        * Predict future change in shoreline.
